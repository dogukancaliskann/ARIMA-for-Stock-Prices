Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models for predicting prices of stocks from XU100 and NASDAQ.

In this practice, I’ve used of Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model to predict prices of stocks.

The practice includes forecasting of Microsoft and Şişecam stocks. 

The reason on selecting stocks from different Exchange markets is comparing results, which will be found by ARIMA models. 

Summary;

I’ve used one of the most useful libraries to work on exchange markets, which is yfinance to handle their historical values. That’s why you are not going to find a dataset that published by me. You are going to be able to reach the historical datas by piece of codes in starting lines. Thus, you can change the whatever stock you want to make a prediction by using their codes in YahooFinance.

After determining the parameters of ARIMA model, I’ve created it. In order to see the results of our predictions day by day, I’ve visualized our predictions with confidence interval.

Let’s skip to the code section.
